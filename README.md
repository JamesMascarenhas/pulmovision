# PulmoVision

PulmoVision is an end-to-end 3D Slicer module designed for automated radiomic analysis of CT lung tumors. The system integrates preprocessing, AI-based segmentation, post-processing, radiomics feature extraction, and visualization into a single reproducible pipeline. This project implements a lightweight 3D U-Net trained on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Task06 Lung dataset (downloaded separately) and embedded directly into a  Slicer workflow. The goal is to demonstrate how standardized, integrated pipelines can improve reproducibility and usability in radiomics research.

## Features

- End-to-end radiomics pipeline for CT lung tumor analysis
- Lightweight 3D U-Net segmentation integrated directly into the workflow
- Standardized preprocessing including resampling, windowing, and normalization
- Automated post-processing and mask cleanup
- Radiomics feature extraction, including geometric and intensity-based statistics
- One-click execution via a custom scripted 3D Slicer module
- Modular design allowing replacement with pretrained or clinically validated models

## Installation

### Python environment

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate pulmovision

or

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3D Slicer Module Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open 3D Slicer.
3. Navigate to Edit → Application Settings → Modules.
4. Add the directory "slicer_module/PulmoVision" to the module search path.
5. Restart Slicer.
6. The PulmoVision module will appear in the module list.

## MSD Task06 Lung data

- Real MSD Task06 Lung volumes are **not** included in this repository. Download them directly from the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) and keep them in a private location (for example `../group_project/Task06_Lung`).
- The `data/msd_example` folder only contains placeholders (`dataset.json`, example filenames, and a README) to document the required directory structure.
- Point the training scripts to the actual dataset location with the `data_root` argument or by setting the `MSD_LUNG_DATA_ROOT` environment variable.

Expected layout under your private data directory:

```
Task06_Lung/
├── dataset.json
├── imagesTr/
├── imagesTs/
└── labelsTr/
```

## Enabling UNet3D Segmentation (PyTorch Support)
The **UNet3D** segmentation mode requires **PyTorch**.
3D Slicer does *not* include PyTorch by default, so it must be installed inside Slicer.

1. Open **Extensions Manager** in Slicer  
2. Search for **“PyTorch”**  
3. Install the **PyTorch** extension  
4. Restart Slicer  
5. Verify installation inside the Python Interactor:

```python
import PyTorchUtils
torch = PyTorchUtils.PyTorchUtilsLogic().torch
print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)
```

If this runs without errors, PyTorch is active and UNet3D segmentation is enabled.

### Running the Full Pipeline (3D Slicer)

1. Load a CT volume into Slicer.
2. Open the PulmoVision module.
3. Select the input volume.
4. Click "Run Full Pipeline".
5. View tumor segmentation overlays and extracted radiomic features.

### Training UNet3D on MSD Task06 Lung

Outside of 3D Slicer, you can train the PyTorch model directly on the MSD Task06 dataset:

```bash
python -m slicer_module.PulmoVision.PulmoBackend.training \
    --train-msd \
    --data-root /path/to/Task06_Lung \
    --epochs 10 \
    --batch-size 1
```

Alternatively, call `train_msd_unet3d` from your own script and let it infer the default location via `MSD_LUNG_DATA_ROOT`.


### Running Standalone Inference (Python)

    from pulmovision.pipeline import run_full_pipeline
    mask, features = run_full_pipeline("path/to/ct.nrrd")
